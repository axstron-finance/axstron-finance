Welcome to the **official repo** where dreams get compiled into reality and money meets magic ✨ through APIs, clean UI, and questionable levels of caffeine intake.

## 💼 Who are we?
We’re **Axstron Finance** — the rebel alliance of fintech.  
Our mission? To tear down the wall between people and financial freedom — one line of code at a time.

We’re not just building features. We’re engineering **financial wizardry** for a world that deserves more than 9-to-5 banking and 404 errors.

---

## 🚀 What are we building?
Think:
- 🧩 Seamless integrations between businesses and banks
- 📲 Payment systems smoother than jazz
- 🔐 Security so tight, even our bugs need clearance
- 💸 Transactions so fast, your wallet will need a seatbelt

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack (aka, our toolbox of chaos):
- Node.js (where the magic happens)
- PostgreSQL / MySQL (your money’s memory)
- TypeScript / JavaScript (typed or not, we ship)
- Docker (because production should behave)
- And just enough sarcasm to keep things interesting

---

## 🙌 Why contribute?
Because changing the financial game is more fun in teams.  
If you’ve got the skills, the memes, or the guts — welcome aboard. Fork it. Clone it. Break it (gently). Let’s build the future together.

## 🤓 Wisdom from the Axstron dojo:
> _“Move fast, break banks (metaphorically).”_  
> _“Deploy like everyone’s watching.”_  
> _“Test like your app owes you money.”_
